				<h1>Rebrickable Competition by yqc: Part 1 - Interest &amp; Topic</h1>
<p>This is part 1 of my survey series for a LEGO MOC competition!</p>
<p>As there are many people out there doing MOC competitions currently, I wanted to try to make a competition as well. However I don't want to end with a competition that nobody participates in, so in this survey you will have the exclusive chance to decide what the survey will be about as well if you would have interest in one.</p>
<hr />
<div class="question text text" id="username">
<p><h3 id="username_title" class="question text text title">Your Rebrickable username</h3><div id="username_description" class="question text text description"><p>
This question is optional, you may take the survey anonymously.</p></p>
</div>
<p><input type="text" id="username_input" name="username" class="answer text text" placeholder="e.g. Nathan" value=""></input></div></p>
<div class="question checkbox" id="interest">
<p><h3 id="interest_title" class="question checkbox title">Would you be interested in joining a MOC competition by me?</h3><div id="interest_description" class="question checkbox description"><p>
You may change your mind later on, this is not a permanent decision.</p><p>There needs to be a minimum demand for a competition to work. If that demand is not there, I won't be able to do a competition.</p></p>

<p>For fairness I will give each MOC different scores out of 10 for different aspects. These aspects may include aesthetic, functionality or a public voting where you can decide who's entry is the best. If you have any ideas on what I could judge, please put them here:</p>
